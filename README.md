# Giftofakind
An Online Gift Shop (GiftOfAKind.com).

I have completed this project by using NetBeans in which tech stack are Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The web application is Flat Design based in which HTML, CSS, and Javascript are used in front-end and Java, JSP and SQL are used in the backend and Apache Tomcat as a local server with MySql.

The highlights of this web application are:
User Security module programmed by Sessional Programming.
Site Flow approach.
Image Zooming to check Quality created by Javascript.
Easy Sign-up and Login Modules Structured by SQL.
